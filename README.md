# ORBIT Resource

Code and reproducible workflows for **ORBIT**, an organoid knowledge and analysis resource. This repository is organized as a set of independent tools and pipelines. Each top-level subdirectory is a self-contained module that collaborators can develop and release on its own schedule.

The default branch is `main`.

## Repository layout

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`omics-pipeline/`](omics-pipeline/) | Multi-omics analysis pipeline for organoid transcriptomic and related datasets |
| [`literature-agent/`](literature-agent/) | Multi-agent system for structured extraction from organoid literature |
| [`knowledge-graph/`](knowledge-graph/) | Knowledge-graph construction, schema, and query utilities |
| [`literature-mcp/`](literature-mcp/) | MCP (Model Context Protocol) services used by the literature extraction agent |
| [`signature-prioritization/`](signature-prioritization/) | OCSP: context-guided prioritization of candidate genes against condition-specific organoid pathway backgrounds |

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chenjiang-bio/ORBIT-resource.git
   cd ORBIT-resource
   ```

2. Open the subdirectory for the module you need and follow its `README.md` for install and usage instructions.

## Collaboration notes

- **Enable the shared git hooks once per clone:**

  ```bash
  git config core.hooksPath .githooks
  ```

  Git does not share hooks through a clone, so this is opt-in. The hook rejects
  commit messages that credit an AI coding agent (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, ...)
  as `Co-authored-by:`. GitHub renders that trailer as a second contributor on
  the repository page, and removing it afterwards requires rewriting published
  history and force-pushing, which breaks every existing clone. Human
  co-authors are unaffected. CI enforces the same rule as a backstop.

- Keep module code, configs, and docs **inside the corresponding subdirectory**.
- Prefer English for all public documentation, comments intended for external readers, and commit messages in this repository.
- Do not commit secrets (API keys, credentials, `.env` files with private tokens).
- Large raw data and model weights should stay out of git; document download or access steps in the module README instead.
